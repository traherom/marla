#summary Instructions for building maRla
#labels Phase-Implementation,Featured

=Quick Start=
maRla builds through an ant script and will build at a basic level in any JDK environment. To fully use the package-for-store and create-installer build targets (producing the Windows installer, most notably), [http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ NSIS] and [http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/ launch4j] need to be installed and on the path.

=Build Environment=
The following environments are recommended for building maRla. Most development can occur with only ant and JDK 1.6+, with the final packaging steps requiring additional setup. The programs listed below should be installed on each OS, with additional notes as needed. Version numbers are those as of the writing of this document, although other version may work as well.

==Windows==
  # *[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Java Development Kit]* v1.6+
  # [http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html NetBeans] v6.9.1+
  # [http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/ launch4j] v3.0.2
    * Must be installed to `C:\Program Files\launch4j`
    * If moved, modifications to [http://code.google.com/p/marla/source/browse/trunk/maRlaIDE/build.xml build.xml] will be needed. See the launch4j task definition in that file
  # [http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ Nullsoft Scriptable Install System] v2.46
    * After install, place the directory with `makensis.exe` on the `PATH`
    * By default, this would be `%Program Files%\NSIS`
  # [http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in Inetc] NSIS plugin - version used is in repository at [http://code.google.com/p/marla/source/browse/trunk/maRlaIDE/inetc.dll inetc.dll]
    * Copy into NSIS plugin directory (`install directory\plugins`)

==Linux==
  # *[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Java Development Kit]* v1.6+
  # [http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html NetBeans] v6.9.1+
  # [http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/ launch4j] v3.0.2
    * Must be installed to `/opt/launch4j/`
    * If moved, modifications to [http://code.google.com/p/marla/source/browse/trunk/maRlaIDE/build.xml build.xml] will be needed. See the launch4j task definition in that file
  # [http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ Nullsoft Scriptable Install System] v2.46
    * After install, ensure the directory with `makensis` on the `PATH`
  # [http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in Inetc] NSIS plugin - version used is in repository at [http://code.google.com/p/marla/source/browse/trunk/maRlaIDE/inetc.dll inetc.dll]
    * Copy into NSIS plugin directory (`install directory\plugins`)

===Ubuntu===
Quick setup for Ubuntu/Debian:
{{{
sudo apt-get install netbeans nsis default-jdk
}}}

Launch4j still needs separate installation.

==Mac OSX==
