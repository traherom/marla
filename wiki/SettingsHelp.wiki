=Introduction=

The settings dialog allows you, the user, to configure the program according your needs. This guide will show you how to do so.


=Program Settings=

The details of the preferences are as follows:
  * Error reports - this will automatically upload any errors in your program to a server that allows us, the developers, to see what went wrong and fix it. It is enabled by default.
  * Debug Mode - Any errors or console output generated by R, pdfTex, or maRla will output in a separate window so that you can see them.
Program and data paths should already be configured for you. If you have a portable configuration you will need to change these to be relative paths.
  * R Path - This is the path to the R executable (R.exe), needed to run statistical operations.
  * PDFTex Path - This is the path to the program (pdflatex.exe, pdftex.exe) that allows maRla to produce nice PDF printouts of your homework.
  * LaTeX Template - This the template for TEX/PDF output.
  * Operations XML - This the XML which contains the common operations for R
  * User Operations XML - If you have a custom operations file, either provided for you by an instructor or created yourself in the maRla Operation Editor, you can put the path to that operations file here. These operations will be merged with the primary operations. If you have multiple user operations files that you'd like to use, separate each path with the pipe (|) symbol.
