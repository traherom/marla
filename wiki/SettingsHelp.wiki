=Introduction=

The settings dialog allows you, the user, to configure the program according your needs. This guide will show you how to do so.


=Program Settings=

The details of the preferences are as follows:
  * Error reports - this will automatically upload any errors in your program to a server that allows us, the developers, to see what went wrong and fix it. It is enabled by default.
  * Debug Mode - Any errors or console output generated by R, pdfTex, or maRla will output in a separate window so that you can see them.
Program and data paths should already be configured for you. If you have a portable configuration you will need to change these to be relative paths.
  * R Path - This is the path to the R executable (R.exe), needed to run statistical operations.
  * PDFTex Path - This is the path to the program (pdflatex.exe, pdftex.exe) that allows maRla to produce nice PDF printouts of your homework.
  * LaTeX Template - This the template for TEX/PDF output.
  * Operations XML - This the XML which contains the common operations for R
  * User Operations XML - This is a path you will have to set if you have created a separate XML operations file with the included operations editor.
