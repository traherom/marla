=Introduction=
The maRla Project is a cross-platform IDE for working through first-semester types of statistics problems. It strives to aid the student in the entire homework cycle, from defining the problem to the final submittable document.

maRla uses [http://www.r-project.org/ R] and [http://www.latex-project.org/ LaTeX] to perform its computation and PDF generation, respectively.
