-- Exception Server --
Exceptions are reported by default to the server specified
at http://code.google.com/p/marla/wiki/CurrentSettings.

This directory contains all files needed to setup your own
exception receiving site. Create the database by doing
	SOURCE("schema.sql")
in MySQL, then create a user in the database with the command
	INSERT INTO users (user, password) VALUES ("username", md5("password"))

From there, you should be able to login to the exception
site and see everything that gets reported.
